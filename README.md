# Setup
1. Clone the repo.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the repo directory.
3. Run `pip install -e foldiak`
4. Navigate into the repo and install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Try running the demo notebook: `examples/bars_example.ipynb`

**Note:** To run the notebook you need the sparsecoding library installed. Its great and definitely worth downloading. 

Note: If you are using a jupyter notebook, you will need to restart the jupyter kernel each time you change a source file.
